; Mines:
; In a 3X3 grid, a bot is placed initially in the [1,1] cell. In one-step, the bot can move to one of its adjacent cells to its left, its right or above but it cannot move to its adjacent cell below. The cells [2,1] and [1,3] have mines and hence the bot must avoid entering these cells. The task assigned to the bot is to reach the the destination cell [3,3].
; Using a constraint solver, find a path following which the bot can accomplish the task.
