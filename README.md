## Assignments

### Assignment 1: N-Queens Problem

#### Problem Specifications

The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Explore the solution code, documentation, and any other relevant files in the [N-Queens Problem](N-Queen.cpp) folder.

### Assignment 2: Missionaries and Cannibals Problem

#### Problem Specifications

The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic river-crossing puzzle. The problem involves three missionaries and three cannibals who must cross a river using a boat. The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that safely transports all individuals from one side of the river to the other. The constraints are that at no point can the number of cannibals on either side outnumber the number of missionaries, and the boat has limited capacity.
